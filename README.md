# Mythical-Mayhem
This is a fun project for me and somr friends (RandomBurger, the dev, Governor Booch, art & Yeg geg, storyboard) to work on.
The Goal is to succesfully learn C# and hopefully make a game.
There is yet any legal yady yadda to be written down.
Mythical mayhem intends to be an indie game that can be played in two different modes.
The first, Versus, will be a pvp style game similar to Brawlhalla, MultiVersus and the giant Super Smash Bros.
The second, Campaign, intends to be more story driven, and more similar to metroidvania games like Hollow Knight or shovel knight, With different campaigns for different characters.
I am current  in phase 0 of the game.
I have figured out how to code in C# (kinda) and made a character movment that will be important later on.
Phase 1 is planned to implement a main screen, character selection screen, baisic ui and graphics.
